# AI-Assisted Legacy Intelligence Platform (ALIP)

# AI-Assisted Legacy Intelligence Platform (ALIP)
## Product Requirements Document (Core / Global)

**Version:** 1.0  
**Owner:** Product & Architecture  
**Status:** Build-Ready  
**Target Launch:** MVP in 6–8 weeks  
**Primary Goal:** Monetizable, trust-first AI-assisted legacy system intelligence

---

## 1. Problem Statement

Mid-sized enterprises (50–500 employees) operate mission-critical legacy systems
(ERP, CRM, custom databases, batch jobs) that:

- Are poorly documented
- Accumulate hidden operational costs
- Create AI adoption pressure without migration appetite
- Depend on tribal knowledge
- Are risky to modify

Current options:
- Big consulting firms → too expensive, slow
- Generic AI copilots → unsafe, shallow
- Rewrites/migrations → high risk, multi-year

**Gap:** No safe, explainable, AI-assisted system intelligence layer for legacy IT.

---

## 2. Product Vision

Provide **AI-assisted, read-only intelligence** over legacy systems that:

- Surfaces cost, risk, and optimization opportunities
- Preserves system safety
- Keeps humans in control
- Produces executive-grade outputs
- Can later evolve into continuous monitoring

---

## 3. Product Scope (Strict MVP)

### IN SCOPE
- Read-only analysis
- Human-in-the-loop recommendations
- AI-assisted documentation & insight generation
- Manual + semi-automated ingestion
- Project-based delivery + early tooling

### OUT OF SCOPE (v1)
- Autonomous code changes
- Production write access
- Full CI/CD automation
- One-click migrations
- Gamification

---

## 4. Target Users

### Primary Buyers
- Head of IT
- Director of Engineering
- Operations / Platform Owners

### Secondary Users
- Senior engineers
- System administrators
- Architecture teams

---

## 5. Core Use Cases

1. Legacy cost & risk audit
2. Knowledge extraction from undocumented systems
3. Query / batch job cost analysis
4. AI opportunity identification (safe PoCs)
5. Executive-level reporting

---

## 6. Functional Requirements

### 6.1 System Ingestion

#### Supported Inputs (MVP)
- Git repositories (read-only)
- Database metadata (schemas, indexes, query logs)
- Configuration files
- Architecture diagrams (PDF / PNG)
- Runbooks / documents (PDF, DOCX)
- Manual SME notes

#### Constraints
- No production writes
- Credential scope limited
- Time-boxed access

---

### 6.2 AI-Assisted Analysis Capabilities

- System topology reconstruction
- Dependency mapping
- Query & batch job cost profiling
- Redundancy detection (logic, data, jobs)
- Risk hotspot identification
- Documentation generation
- Change-impact simulation (theoretical)

---

### 6.3 Human-in-the-Loop Workflow

- All AI outputs require explicit review
- Confidence scoring per insight
- Traceability to source artifacts
- Reviewer feedback loop

---

### 6.4 Outputs & Deliverables

#### Mandatory Outputs
- System Architecture Map (generated + validated)
- Top 10 Cost Drivers
- Top 10 Risk Drivers
- AI Opportunity Shortlist
- Executive Summary (PDF)
- Technical Appendix

---

## 7. Non-Functional Requirements

### Security
- Read-only credentials
- Secrets never persisted
- Audit logs for access
- Isolated environments per client

### Explainability
- Source references for all AI outputs
- No black-box recommendations

### Compliance (baseline)
- GDPR-aware data handling
- EU AI Act “low-risk tool” posture

---

## 8. Architecture Overview

### 8.1 Agent-Based Architecture

The system is designed as a **multi-agent, human-supervised intelligence pipeline**.
